# Convin challenge

### Problem Statement

• Make a React application

• On loading, of the page, make an API request to fetch all users. ( LIST USERS API Endpoint)( https://reqres.in/)

• Store all the data in the redux store

• Get the total number of users from the response and make those many buttons on the web page ( do not hard code the number, it has to come from the API)

• For example: [ 1 ] , [ 2 ], [ 3 ], [ 4 ], [ 5 ].... [ n ]

• On clicking the button retrieve that users data only using [ SINGLE USER API Endpoint ) (do not use data from the previous API call )( https://reqres.in/)

• Do not add event listeners to each button

• After retrieving show the response, create a card and fill info on the page, only one user card will be shown at a time. ( when the page loads for the first time, don't show a card,
you may keep a placeholder card or text asking the user to click on any button )

<br/>

Bonus:

• create a loading indicator to show that the API request is in progress
